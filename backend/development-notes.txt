# Permissions
-------------

* A full list of all users/profiles will not be accessible by anyone. Only a detail view is allowed.
* A user has full CRUD permissions over their own items (goals, milestones) and settings.
* A user has only read permissions of their friends' items and no permissions to access their friends' settings.
* A user has no permissions accessing anything from users that are not their friends.

Summary of permissions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Model      | User | Friends | Public | Notes
Goal       | CRUD | -R--    | ----   |
Milestone  | CRUD | -R--    | ----   |
Update     | CRUD | -R--    | ----   |
User       | ---- | ----    | ----   | Internal, not exposed through any API
Profile    | CRUD | -R--    | C---   | Some attributes are hidden for friends
Friendship | CRUD | CRUD    | ----   | Model belongs to both users
Message    | CRUD | CRUD    | ----   | Model belongs to both users
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overall our models have 2 types of permission classes:
1). CRUD | -R-- | ----
    For user-owned objects like goals and updates

2). CRUD | -R-- | C---
    Unique permissions for profiles additionally allow them to be publicly created.

3). CRUD | CRUD | ----
    Objects that are shared between users. All users have the full set of permissions.

* Users have no permission classes becuase they don't have a associated views.
* For authentication, all views required a user to be authenticated. Therefore, the authentication class should probably extend the default IsAuthenticated class provided by REST framework.
* Permissions should be controlled at a view level but can be overridden at an object level (see documentation)



# Visibility
------------
* Visibility can be controlled at 2 levels:
    1. View querysets can exclude and filter by specific fields.
    2. Serializers can restrict what fields are displayed.
* No user has the ability to list all of any object globally.

Goal
    - A user can view their own goals and the goals of their friends.

Milestone
    - Same as goals.

Update
    - Same as goals.

User
    - N/A (not exposed).

Profile
    - A user can only view their own profile and partially view the profile fields of their friends.
    - A global search of all profiles can be performed that must match a username exactly. This API will be throttled and not be a part of the Profile model's viewset. 

Friendship
    - Users can view friendships that they are a part of.

Message
    - Users can view messages where they are the sender or the sendee.
